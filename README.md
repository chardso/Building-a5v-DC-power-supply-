# Building-a5v-DC-power-supply-

A5v power supply is the supply where the output is regulated using adissipative regulating circuit.

ADVANTAGES OF A5V POWER SUPPLY.

-They are extremely stable.

-Have alow ripple.

-Have no switching frequencies to produce electromagnetic interference[EMI]

H0W TO BUILD.

STEP1.

-Selection of aregulator IC.

STEP2.

-Selection of the transformer.

STEP3.

-Selection of diodes for the bridge.

STEP4.

-selection of smoothing capacitors and calculations.

STEP5.

-Making the power supply safe.

COMPONENTS USED.

-A9v wall adapter .we can use an adapter that outputs adifferent voltage as long as its between 7v and 35v.

-One LM7805 voltage regulator,this regulator takes adc voltage from 7v to 35v and outputs astable dc voltage of 5v.

-One breadboard.

-0.33uf and 0.1uf ceramic capacitors,one of each decouple the input and output of the LM7805.

-One 500mA fuse[optional] to protect the source from short circuit.

-Aled and a 330Ohm resistor [optional] to know if the power supply is on or off.
